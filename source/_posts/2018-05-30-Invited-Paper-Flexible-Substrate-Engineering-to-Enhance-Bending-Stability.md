## Abstract

We propose a novel substrate structure to achieve excellent mechanical flexibility. Electronic components on a flexible substrate are affected by surface strain when bent. Our flexible substrate contains a strain‐absorbing layer that can effectively reduce the surface strain; thus, flexible devices can be more flexible with minimal electrical degradation.
