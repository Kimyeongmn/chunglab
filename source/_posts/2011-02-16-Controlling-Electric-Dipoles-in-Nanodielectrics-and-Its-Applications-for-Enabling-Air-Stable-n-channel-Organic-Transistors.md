### Abstract

We present a new method to manipulate the channel charge density of field-effect transistors using dipole-generating self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with different anchor groups. Our approach maintains an ideal interface between the dipole layers and the semiconductor while changing the built-in electric potential by 0.41−0.50 V. This potential difference can be used to change effectively the electrical properties of nanoelectronic devices. We further demonstrate the application of the SAM dipoles to enable air-stable operation of n-channel organic transistors.
